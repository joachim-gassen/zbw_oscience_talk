## Code and Data for Talk on the Impact of Open Science in Economcis

This repo contains the materials that I used and the resulting slides of I talk that I gave at the wonderful [ZBW Symposium: Open Science â€“ Forschungstransparenz in den Wirtschaftswissenschaften](https://www.zbw.eu/de/ueber-zbw/veranstaltungen/symposium-open-science-forschungstransparenz-in-den-wirtschaftswissenschaften) on Open Science in the field of economics. While the conference and so most of the slides are in German, I guess you will get the gist of them by running them through Google Translate in case you are interested.

Anyway my main point of the talk is trivial: To make open science matter, we should not only focus on reproducibility and replicability but also and maybe even more so on resuability and collaboration. 

To illustrate the point, I took a very quick look on the download numbers of the repositories linked to journals of the American Economic Association on [OpenICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/). As I did not find an easily accessible API that provides these data, I scraped them with the code in this repo and linked that data with citation data that I obtained from Scopus. The final data that I use for the "analysis" in my talk is available in the data folder, the raw data is not included due to licensing issues but can be generated by running the code in the root folder.
